# Project Introduction
This project focuses on categorizing and explaining prediction errors of image recognition model using ObjectNet dataset, Visual Saliency Maps and Neural
Network architectures. The main focus is to introspect the model architecture to identify the patterns or rules which leads to drop in the perfoemnace of the models on different datasets.

  This is a Scientific Team Project with a team size of 6.

### Motivation:
